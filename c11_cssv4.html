	       <h5>How to surf</h5>
	         <p>Surfing is an extremely fun water sport, in which you ride waves. To 
	       surf you paddling out into the waves. Once you see the wave you want to ride 
	       you turn your board around. Than you palle as hard as you can and once you 
	       catch the wave you keep your wave even so you don't tip. Than you pop up both 
	       feet at once. Than you keep your balance and ride the wave. Once you get enough
	       practice you can start to do tricks like the curve, cut back, foam climber, 
	       floater, tail side, superman, tail rider, and many more.</p>

	       <h5>Types of surf boards</h5>
	         <p>There are many different kinds of surfboards. Some examples of common 
	       boards are short board, fish, long board, foam, and hybrid. I personally prefer
	       my custom made board.Usually you surf when it's warm, but sometimes the water 
	       is old so you wear a wetsuit. The types of wetsuits are shorty, long jon,
	       semi dry, full, and triathlon suit.</p><br/>

	       <h5>Places to surf</h5>
	         <p>Surfing is so much fun. It is relaxing and exciting at the same time.
	       It is sometimes dangerous in some surf spots. Sharks thinks surfers look like 
	       seals underwater. Just be careful and you can stay safe. Still a lot of
	       surf spots are beautiful and have great waves. These spots include of
	       super bank Australia, Pipeline Ohau (hawaii), Bundoran Beach Donegal(ireland),
	       Jeffery's Bay Africa, Lima Peru, El salvador, and many more.</p><br/>
